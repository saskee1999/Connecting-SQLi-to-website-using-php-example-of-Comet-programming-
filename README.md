# Connecting-SQLi-to-website-using-php-example-of-Comet-programming-
This is an implementation of comet programming. The sqli database is connect to the sample website dynamically, 
so if the database changes, the actual change will be shown in the site in real time. I used xampp to test this,
so if you want to run on your machine you will need to install it too, then put it in a folder inside htdocs.
